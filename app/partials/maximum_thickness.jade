  h2 Maximum absorption
  p.
    The signal-to-noise ratio depends on the differential phase signal
    \\(\\phi\\) which is in principle not easy to estimate. In any case,
    though, the domain of \\(\\phi\\) will be limited to \\([-\\pi, \\pi]\\)
    so that a standard deviation above \\(\\sigma_\\phi \\gtrsim 2\\pi/5 = 1.25\\)
    (Rose criterion) should lead to technically undetectable contrasts even
    in the most favourable scenario.
  p.
    \\(\\sigma_\\phi(A)\\) is strictly decreasing with \\(A\\). Therefore,
    there is a minimum transmission \\(A\\) needed for the noise to be under
    a given threshold \\(\\sigma_\\text{max}\\).
  p.
    Given an energy and a material, we show in the interactive table on the
    right the maximum thickness allowed at the noise level shown on the plot
    on the left.

  p.
    With the current parameters, the minimum transmission required to stay
    under the maximum noise level is {{minimum_transmission | number:2}}.
